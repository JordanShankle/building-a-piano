This is a project I did while first learning to code, September 23rd, 2022. I did it as part of the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum.

In this project, I learned Responsive Design. Responsive Design tells your webpage how it should look on different-sized screens.
  I used CSS and Responsive Design to code a piano. You'll also learn more about media queries and pseudo selectors.
